# tmux monitor stuff

So I want to capture my dev work in tmux so I can train models on how to program
and actually use a computer. More data is good.

This is my tmux setup

## todo

- [ ] fix the session recorder
- [ ] get the monitor panel working so i don't need to manually create it each
      reboot.
