asciinema tmux pane recorder

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è why!?

I wanted to record my terminal development workflow, so I can later summarise it
and tune models on me programming and using TUI apps. So I did a proof of
concept of collection by recording `asciinema rec -c "tmux att"`, which ended up
being enormous and largely irrelevant.

Recording the top level is about 450MB for a day's worth of hacking in my one day
test. This compressed to ~15MB with xz, but I don't have any idea of where the
window splits are, and don't trust LLM inference to infer them. As an example for
comparison, a test window looks like this:

For my next iteration, I tried recording individual panes. Which, with lots of
long-running jobs and monitors showing log files, ended up being ... uh... a
pane? Not just saving window geometry and stitching it back together again, but
some background panes had excessively large outputs. They're in the background,
so I don't care about them.

So for mk3, I made this recording tool that follows the active pane by detecting
the pane change, dumping the contents, injecting control codes and stovepiping
everything after it into `asciinema` via tail.

The session above looks like this as I navigate, which shows exactly what I'm up
to, far better IMO:

# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è usage

Currently there's a release, and you can just drop that into `~/.local/bin` but
it's really a test of the release process so is a bit flaky. For best results,
run this from inside your tmux session:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/bitplane/tvmux.git
$ cd tvmux
$ make start
# ... some time later ...
$ make stop
```

You'll see a symlink linking to the `.cast` file which will be under `./.cache`.
There's `make` steps for build and install but without testing, who knows where
the outputs will go (lol)

# What's next?

- [ ] Per-project recording, which in my use-case is a per-window thing.
- [ ] Restoring alternative terminal buffers between switches
- [ ] Quantizing the data going in because they're often too large. 
- [ ] Config files, env vars and args via a bash library.
- [ ]  Keep using it and adding turd polish!
